# Module 1 Final Project:  Check Yo' Self

## Overview of Project and Goals

*   For our Module 1 final project, I created a list making website titled "Check Yo Self."  Other than the header at the top, the site has two main sections:  A left side for creating to-do lists, and a right side for viewing created lists and checking off completed tasks.
*   The Goals of the project were to utlize the concepts taught in Module 1 while creating the website. 

### Specifically, to solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
1. DRY JavaScript
2. Use localStorage to persist data
3. Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
4. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM

## Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections

* Technologies Used:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Classes, Local Storage

### Challenges:

From the beginning, I looked at this project as a great opportunity to show what I knew challenge myself to really think through the concepts.  I found the entire project challenging but in the end, very rewarding.  I had never used Flexbox before so learning and implementing that was the first challenge.  From there, writing well though out JavaScript functions took quite a while but I went line by line and really had a map of what I wanted to do.  Slowly but surely, I made good progress.  The biggest challenge of the project was using local storage to persist the class and instance data.  I spent an entire day getting nowhere before breaking through!

### Wins and other reflections

This project was a huge success for me!  I feel like I took some really big steps with this project. From the start, I wanted to see what I could accomplish on my own and see how far I could get.  Each step was a struggle, but I stuck with it, stayed calm, and in the end, overcame some big hurdles and ended on a high note.  While the project may not result in a passing grade, I feel good about what I accomplished.  I am a lot more comfortable with writing functions, using DOM manipulatio, understanding how data works with classes, and using local storage. In addition, I used console logging, the debugger, google research(a lot!) and my dev tools at every step of the project.  In short, the fog is starting to clear and I'm starting to get it.  While I still need a lot of improvement in many areas (I didn't use any branches-I just spaced it!), I can honestly say that I did over 95% of this project on my own, and for that I feel great!
